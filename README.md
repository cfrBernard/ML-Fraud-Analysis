# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions from a highly imbalanced credit card dataset using exploratory data analysis and zone-based feature engineering.

The goal is to better understand the structure of fraudulent activity by **identifying high-, medium-, and low-risk zones** in the feature space â€” paving the way for interpretable rules and better model input features.

## Project Overview
Credit card fraud detection is a critical problem complicated by the extreme imbalance between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. This project explores:

- Data visualization and statistical analysis of transaction features
- Defining fraud risk zones based on feature distributions
- Engineering risk-score features to improve detection
- Building interpretable and effective machine learning models
> The approach enables both ML-driven and rule-based fraud detection workflows.

## Objectives
- Extract interpretable, risk-based features to augment fraud detection models
- Provide a flexible framework for hybrid detection systems combining ML and rules
- Achieve high recall on fraudulent transactions while controlling false positives

## Key Features
- Zone-based risk scoring on continuous features
- Threshold-based fraud classification with adjustable sensitivity
- CLI tool for batch prediction on new data files
- Modular code structure for easy extension and maintenance
