# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions from a highly imbalanced credit card dataset using exploratory data analysis and zone-based feature engineering.

The goal is to better understand the structure of fraudulent activity by **identifying high-, medium-, and low-risk zones** in the feature space — paving the way for interpretable rules and better model input features.

## 🐣 About Me

This project represents my first real experience in data analysis.
It was both a learning journey and a hands-on exploration of how to approach imbalanced datasets, extract value from statistical distributions, and build interpretable insights from raw features.

> I focused on being curious, careful, and creative — and this work reflects my early steps in the data science world.

## 🎯 Objective
The main objective is to enrich future fraud detection models with interpretable, risk-based features derived from cleanly defined zones. This can serve:

- As direct input to ML models (e.g. binary flags: "is_high_risk")
- For building simple rule-based filters or hybrid systems
- For increasing fraud detection recall in early stages

## Experience Gained
- Gained hands-on practice with:

  - Data visualization for fraud detection
  - Feature segmentation based on class distribution
  - Fraud rate analysis over continuous ranges
  - Tradeoffs between signal purity vs. transaction volume

- Improved intuition around:

  - How fraud concentrates in certain regions
  - The importance of interpretability in fraud detection
  - Designing features when labels are extremely imbalanced
